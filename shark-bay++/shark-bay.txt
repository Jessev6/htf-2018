The last report from the TURING logger AI came up with some strange patterns when analyzing the log streams collected by your Hackatron3310 from the artifact.
Some of these patterns are similar to the cultures of cyano bacteria in our labs, others show astonishing evolutions our engineers have never seen before.

Hacker, help us with the ongoing analysis of this.  Our engineers started cultivating several new generations of strains of these elements.
We need to figure out if the artifact is alive or if this is just a side-effect?  How do these elements live and die?
Some seem to go on living forever while others die out after a number of iterations.  We have to solve this enigma to unwrap the artifact.

Go read the specs to find out the exact details of these strains...
