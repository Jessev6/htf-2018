Hacker, our engineering department has reported some communication problems.
Our uplink satellite at the site has been eroded, it seems that the radiation from the artifact was stronger than we have expected.
We need you to transfer our stream to the engineering department in order to operate our deployed devices.
Our signal has been sent to your Hackatron3310, make sure you calibrate it the correct format.
We have provided you with the necessary documentation in order to solve this issue.
