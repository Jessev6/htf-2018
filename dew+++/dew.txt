Code: DEW
Level: Hard

Hackers,

After our, sadly, failed attempt to breach the artifact's hull with the drilling bots.
We are initializing operation DEW...
Two years ago our agency sent a prototype space-laser up to the International Space Station (ISS).
The plasma laser has been installed there and has since been waiting on an opportunity to be tested, so today is that day.

The prototype laser is a type of directed-energy weapon, in short DEW, that uses several lasers to form an electrically conductive laser-induced plasma channel (LIPC).
A fraction of a second later, a powerful electric current is sent down this plasma channel and delivered to the target.

As you might imagine such a powerful and high-tech device needs hundreds of settings before it can be used in the field.
Your task is to run the power setting simulations, as the laser theoretically has no power limit.
The simulations need to determine the sweet spot setting where the laser will breach the artifact's hull, but will not cause to much collateral damage.
